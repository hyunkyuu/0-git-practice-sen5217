## My Article 
[Prompt Engineering: Challenges, Strengths, and Its Place in Software Development's Future](https://www.infoq.com/articles/prompt-engineering/). 

### Summary
The article I chose discusses how prompt engineering is evolving, and its similarities (and differences) to software engineering. The author argues that prompt engineering is becoming a structured discipline similar to programming (e.g. uses roles, tasks, constraints, etc.). The developing design patterns and techniques of prompt engineering make it a strong counterpart of traditional programming. However, prompt engineering and programming can differ in their approach. Prompt engineering does not require formal syntax, allows errors, and creates varying outputs. Programming, on the other hand, is more structured, precisise, and deterministic. 

While prompt engineering continues to evole and grow in importance, the article argues that its long-term role will be limited, as programming is still essential in areas where prompt engineering lacks, such as building high-performance software. In the future, software engineering may instead involve a blend of both approaches. 

### Why I Found it Interesting
I found the relationship between prompt engineering and software engineering really interesting—especially as computer science students, many of us already use AI as a learning tool. It’s something to consider how prompt engineering might evolve into a meaningful part of our future careers. 

#### Comments
Hyunkyu Park: It was interesting that the article doesn’t just praise prompt engineering, but also highlights its weaknesses, such as variability and unpredictability. I found the clear distinction between where prompts are useful and where programming is still necessary very realistic. From my own experience, detailed, step-by-step prompts tend to be more effective.
